- I currently serve as a research scientist at Tiktok/Bytedance AI Lab,Singapore. 
- Before joining Bytedance, I obtained my PhD degree from the school of computer science and engineering in Nanyang Technological University
(NTU), Singapore. In NTU, I am supervised by Prof. [Yew-Soon Ong (FIEEE)](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asysong/home.html) and Dr. [Abhishek Gupta](https://sites.google.com/site/abhishekguptamemecomput/). 
- My recent research interests mainly focus on security and privacy related topics in different machine learning/deep learning domains, including
deep reinforcement learning, computer vision and speech recognition.
- Currently hiring research scientist intern located at either Singapore or China Mainland (Beijing/Shanghai). Please send cv to xinghua.qu@bytedance.com
