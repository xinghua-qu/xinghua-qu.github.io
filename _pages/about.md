I am a research scientist and _tech lead_ at ByteDance (Seed), specializing in training multimodal large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents using **reinforcement learning (RL)**. I earned my PhD from Nanyang Technological University (NTU, Singapore), where my research centered on "Adversarial Robustness of Deep Reinforcement Learning".
