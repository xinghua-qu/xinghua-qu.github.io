I am a research scientist and _tech lead_ at ByteDance Seed, specializing in training multimodal large language models (LLMs) and LLM agents using **reinforcement learning (RL)**. I got my PhD degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU, Singapore) in 2022, where my research centered on "Adversarial Robustness of Deep Reinforcement Learning".
