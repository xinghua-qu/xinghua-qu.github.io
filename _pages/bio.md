<!-- I currently serve as a research scientist at Bytedance AI Lab,Singapore. Before joining Bytedance, I obtained my PhD degree from the school of computer science and engineering in Nanyang Technological University
(NTU), Singapore. In NTU, I am honored to be supervised by Prof. [Yew-Soon Ong (FIEEE)](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asysong/home.html) and Dr. [Abhishek Gupta](https://sites.google.com/site/abhishekguptamemecomput/). 
My recent research interests mainly focus on security and privacy related topics in different machine learning/deep learning domains, including
deep reinforcement learning, computer vision and speech recognition. My research has been published on leading journals and conferences in related
domains, such as TNNLS, TCYB, TCDS, AAMAS, RecSys etc. In 2020, I received Research Highlight awards from the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (ASTAR), Singapore.
