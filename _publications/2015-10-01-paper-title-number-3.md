collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'we introduce three types of frame-correlation transfers (FCTs) (i.e., anterior case transfer, random projection-based transfer, and principal components-based transfer) with varying degrees of computational complexity in generating adversaries via a genetic algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the tradeoff between the complexity and potency of the transfer mechanism by exploring four fully trained state-of-the-art policies on six Atari games.'
